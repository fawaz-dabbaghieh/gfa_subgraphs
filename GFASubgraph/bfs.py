    Runs bfs and returns the neighborhood smaller than size

    Using only bfs was resulting in a one-sided neighborhood.
    So the neighborhood I was getting was mainly going from the start node
    into one direction because we have FIFO and it basically keeps going
    in that direction. So I decided to split check if have two possible directions
    From start, too look in both directions separately and add that to the whole neighborhood
